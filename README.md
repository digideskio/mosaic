#[ MOSAICÂ ] Mosaic - Map bounding box to PNG

This application allows you to request map tiles from in a specified bounding box. The output is mosaic of tiles, cropped exactly on that bounds.
Can be used with any map tiles that respect the TMS specification.

##Installation
The app depends on GraphicsMagick <http://www.graphicsmagick.org/>. 

E.g. For Mac can be installed via brew:

	brew install graphicsmagick

Install application dependences:

	npm install
	
##Usage

You just need to change the config.json file with your preferences. Remember to specify a subdomain for the tile provider if it has multiple subdomains:

	{
    	"name": "test",
    	"sw" : [45.3921679, 9.065897500000005],
    	"ne": [45.5359728, 9.277915300000018],
    	"zoom": 13,
    	"url": "http://a.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
	}	

and than run:

	node app
	
The app create two folders: one with all single 256 tiles, and another with two files: `name.mosaic.png` that is the full image not cropped to boundingbox, 	and the `name.png` that is the cropped image.
